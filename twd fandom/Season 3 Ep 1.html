        Eight months after Rick (Andrew Lincoln) kills Shane and the onslaught of the Greene     Family Farm, the world continues to grow increasingly more dangerous while Lori's (Sarah Wayne Callies) pregnancy advances. Rick, who has now assumed a dictatorial-like leadership over his group of survivors, and company are now in search of a safe haven, as Lori is due to give birth any day. While hunting for food, Rick and Daryl (Norman Reedus) happen upon a prison complex—West Georgia Correctional Facility—full of walkers. After Rick tells the group about the prison and how it could be a new home for them, the group clears out the outer prison courtyard of walkers and secure their position within the fences. As many of the dispatched walkers wear prison or guard uniforms, Rick believes the prison may have fallen early during the epidemic and could hold a large supply cache. Lori later tries to talk to Rick about the child, but, as their relationship deteriorates, he dismisses her so that he can focus on planning their approach for the next day.

        <p id="para2">Elsewhere, Andrea (Laurie Holden) has fallen severely ill with influenza since being separated from the group and taken in by Michonne (Danai Gurira), the hooded figure with the sword that rescued her from walkers attacking her in the woods. The two aren't faring well and have taken refuge in a deer cooler. Michonne scours for aspirin or other medication from a store to reduce Andrea's fever. She returns to Andrea, who also feels like a burden to Michonne and tells her to abandon her, but Michonne refuses. They conclude they must move on as a group of walkers are advancing, so they head off out towards the woods.

        <p id="para3"> The next day, the group methodically clear out the inner prison yard of walkers before moving into the prison to clear out a cell block. Daryl notes one wore civilian clothes, suspecting there may have been a breach. Rick and the others start clearing away the walker bodies, giving Lori the chance to confide to Hershel (Scott Wilson) that she fears her child may be stillborn and reanimate as a walker, but Hershel calms her down and affirms her that the child is in fine health. Later, Rick, Daryl, Hershel, Glenn (Steven Yeun), Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) go on a scouting mission to other parts of the prison and move deeper into the interior, many in total darkness. All seems quiet at first, but suddenly they run into several groups of walkers. In the darkness and confusion, Glenn and Maggie get separated from the group. When it's finally safe to venture back out, Hershel tries to find the two but is bitten on his calf by a walker that only appeared to be dead. The group then reunites and assists Hershel in getting out of the corridor. They take refuge and barricade themselves in the cafeteria, where Rick, in an attempt to save Hershel, amputates his leg with a hatchet to prevent the infection from spreading. However, this causes Hershel to go into shock and pass out from the ensuing blood loss. Then, five shadow figures appear in the adjacent room watching the group. Daryl prepares to fire, but realizes they are not walkers but are actually surviving prisoners.</p>
