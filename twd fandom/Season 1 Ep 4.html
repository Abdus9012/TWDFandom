            The episode opens as sisters Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Amy (Emma Bell) are fishing for the survivors in a nearby quarry lake, discussing their childhood and hopes that Florida, where their parents live, was not hit as hard by the zombie epidemic.

            In Atlanta, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Daryl (Norman Reedus), Glenn (Steven Yeun) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) have discovered the severed hand of Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), Daryl's brother, where Rick had handcuffed him on the roof of a store. They follow a trail of blood to show Merle had killed some walkers and managed to cauterize the stump of his hand before finding out that he escaped the building, resulting for the case being cold

        <p id="para2">At the survivors' camp, Jim (Andrew Rothenberg) begins digging holes, refusing to explain why. As the survivors press him, he lashes back at them, forcing Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) to restrain Jim. Jim breaks down, explaining how he lost his family to walkers, and that a dream inspired him to dig the holes. Jim warns Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) to keep her son Carl (Chandler Riggs) safe</p>

        <p id="para3"> In Atlanta, Rick's group gets into conflict with the Vatos, a group of Latinos that kidnap Glenn and demand they exchange Rick's bag of weapons for his return. When they face-off at the Vatos' base, they discover it is a hidden nursing home, and the Vatos are only trying to protect their own family. Rick leaves some of his weapons and ammo for the Vatos, and Glenn is returned unharmed. Rick's group finds their vehicle missing, and suspect Merle took it seeking vengeance on the survivors', and they start to race on foot back to the camp.

            At the camp, the other survivors are enjoying dinner when a horde of walkers suddenly appear, biting several of the members including Amy and Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich). Rick and the others arrive in time to quell the walkers. Amy dies in Andrea's arms, and as the others stand around in shock, Jim recalls why he had dug those holes.</p>

                <h3 text align = "center"> Reception </h3>
            <p id="para4">Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club gave it a grade of Bâˆ’ on a F to A scale, commenting it was a step down in quality from the pilot, but said it "had many good qualities" and "the show still looks fantastic, and the choice to use 16mm film pays off time after time, giving everything a stark, bright quality that fits the mood perfectly."[18] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 7 out of 10, and also noted how it was a weaker episode than the pilot. Goldman disliked the introduction of Merle, calling him "ridiculous", but enjoyed the sequence in which Rick and Glenn cover themselves in guts to disguise them from the zombies. He commented, "Overall, this episode had its fun moments, feeling more like an adrenalin-filled straight up horror movie than the more slow-paced pilot. But it also lacked the pilot's emotion and depth."
