            The episode opens in medias res as former Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) scavenges for gas and supplies at an abandoned convenience store in rural Georgia on a deserted highway. He spots a little girl (Addy Miller), but she turns out to be a zombie. When she charges towards him, Rick shoots her in the head.
            Returning to several weeks prior, Rick is seriously injured while chasing down criminals alongside his partner and childhood friend Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) as he is shot in his shoulder causing him to go into a coma. Hospitalized as a result of the injury, Rick experiences a series of dreamlike encounters with friends and family as he languishes in a coma.

        <p id="para2">When he regains consciousness, he finds the hospital abandoned and horrifically ransacked; the walls sprayed with blood, destroyed equipment everywhere, and dead bodies littering the hallway. He walks past a set of double doors secured with heavy chains and spray-painted with the ominous warning "Don't Open Dead Inside". From the far side of the secured doors, Rick hears growling while an unknown menace pushes against the locked doors. Outside, he finds scores of dead bodies  some covered in makeshift body bags, others strewn about randomly. As he makes his way home, he sees a zombified woman dragging her legless body towards him. He ignores her and returns home, finding his family has long-since fled. Rick encounters Morgan Jones (Lennie James) and his son Duane (Adrian Kali Turner), and they explain the zombie apocalypse that occurred while Rick was in a coma. Morgan warns that the only way to stop the zombies is to destroy the brain, and cautions that the zombies are attracted to noise. Rick decides to head to Atlanta where a refugee camp is rumored to exist, though Morgan would rather stay behind. Rick, Morgan, and Duane go to the Sheriff Department Headquarters where Rick was assigned and take weapons, radios, ammunition and a patrol car. While there Rick encounters a zombified former colleague, whom he shoots in the head. Rick splits the stash of weapons and supplies from the police station with Morgan and promises to stay in touch with a walkie-talkie. Morgan and Duane return to their home, and Morgan, armed with a sniper rifle from the Sheriff's Headquarters and perched in a second story window, fires at the zombies wandering in the street in front of their home. While Duane sits nervously downstairs  unsure why Morgan is shooting out the window, it becomes clear that Morgan is trying to attract his wife  now a zombie. When she arrives, drawn to the noise of gunfire, Morgan gets her head in sight, but he is unable to shoot her.

        On his way out of town, Rick stops by the legless zombie. He apologizes for what had happened to her and he shoots her. Later, he is forced to abandon his car when he runs out of gas. He finds a farmhouse nearby where the owners of the house are found to be dead, he takes their horse and continues the rest of the way on horseback. When he radios Morgan the next day, his signal is picked up by a survivors' camp where Shane, Rick's wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), and his son Carl (Chandler Riggs) are safe. Unaware that it is Rick on the other line, they lose radio signal before they can warn him of the dangers in Atlanta. Shane and Lori briefly kiss before Carl intervenes. Lori reassures Carl that she will stay with him.</p>

        <p id="para3">In the seemingly empty city, Rick follows a helicopter flying overhead right into a horde of zombies. They attack him and his horse, killing his horse and forcing him to drop his bag of weapons and crawl under a tank, and as they follow him under it Rick contemplates suicide a split second before noticing a trapdoor to take shelter in the vehicle. After he shoots a walker inside, he hears a voice from the tank's radio sarcastically ask if he is comfortable, before the scene exits with a top down view of Atlanta overrun by walkers.</p>
