            Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) struggles to escape the handcuffs after his group abandoned him on the Atlanta department store's rooftop, swearing vengeance on Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) for putting him there. He starts to beg for God's forgiveness when walkers start trying to force open the rooftop door. Merle starts trying desperately to reach for some tools nearby, screaming that he will never beg God again.

        <p id="para2">Elsewhere, Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) leads Rick and the other members of his group back to the survivors' camp outside Atlanta. Rick is overwhelmed to find his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son Carl (Chandler Riggs) among the survivors, along with his friend and partner Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal). As the group is reunited, they discover a walker nearby, which they quickly dispatch, though fear that this may be a sign of trouble as they had yet to see walkers anywhere near camp. Merle's brother Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) returns from hunting to learn of Merle's fate and becomes furious at Rick.</p>

        <p id="para3"> Feeling guilty for leaving Merle handcuffed as well as wanting to retrieve his bag of guns, Rick arranges a rescue group, including Daryl. While Rick is gone, Lori tells Shane that with Rick back she must end her relationship with Shane, who then becomes bitter. When Shane witnesses Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich) striking his wife Carol (Melissa McBride) for not focusing on the laundry for the group, he takes his anger out on Ed severely and threatens to kill him if he ever touches any of the women in the group again.

            Meanwhile, Rick's group arrives back to the department store in Atlanta and make their way up to the rooftop, finding Merle apparently gone. However, they find a hacksaw sitting beside Merle's severed right hand within bloody handcuffs hanging from a pipe; Daryl goes into a fit of rage and screams as the others look on helplessly.</p>

                <h3 text align = "center"> Reception </h3>
            <p id="para4">Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club gave it a grade of Bâˆ’ on a F to A scale, commenting it was a step down in quality from the pilot, but said it "had many good qualities" and "the show still looks fantastic, and the choice to use 16mm film pays off time after time, giving everything a stark, bright quality that fits the mood perfectly."[18] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 7 out of 10, and also noted how it was a weaker episode than the pilot. Goldman disliked the introduction of Merle, calling him "ridiculous", but enjoyed the sequence in which Rick and Glenn cover themselves in guts to disguise them from the zombies. He commented, "Overall, this episode had its fun moments, feeling more like an adrenalin-filled straight up horror movie than the more slow-paced pilot. But it also lacked the pilot's emotion and depth."
