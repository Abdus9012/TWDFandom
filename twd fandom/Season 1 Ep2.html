            Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is able to escape the tank and the swarm of walkers with help from Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), leading them to safety of a department store. Rick meets the other members of Glenn's scavenging group, including Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), a virulent racist, and T-Dog (IronE Singleton), a black man dismayed by Merle's attitude. When Merle attempts to beat up T-Dog and assert control, Rick subdues him and handcuffs him to a pipe on the store's roof.

        <p id="para2">Glenn makes contact with the survivors' camp outside the city, where, unknown to Rick, his friend Shane Walsh, and his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son Carl (Chandler Riggs), are safe. Shane and Lori still believe Rick is dead and have begun a sexual relationship.

            As walkers swarm the building, the group finds its escape route through the sewer cut off. Rick spots a box truck nearby that they could use to escape. Rick and Glenn cover themselves in the blood and viscera of a dispatched walker to mask their scent from other walkers as they walk through the horde.</p>

        <p id="para3"> It soon starts to rain, washing away the walker scent, and Rick and Glenn make a break for the truck. Glenn uses the car alarm on a Dodge Challenger to draw the walkers away, while Rick drives the box truck to the department store's cargo doors. In the rush to escape, T-Dog accidentally drops the handcuff key for Merle down a storm drain, and they are forced to abandon him; however, T-Dog secures the roof access door with a heavy chain to give Merle some protection. The remaining group travel with Rick back to the survivors' camp, with Glenn following close behind.</p>

                <h3 text align = "center"> Reception </h3>
            <p id="para4">Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club gave it a grade of Bâˆ’ on a F to A scale, commenting it was a step down in quality from the pilot, but said it "had many good qualities" and "the show still looks fantastic, and the choice to use 16mm film pays off time after time, giving everything a stark, bright quality that fits the mood perfectly."[18] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 7 out of 10, and also noted how it was a weaker episode than the pilot. Goldman disliked the introduction of Merle, calling him "ridiculous", but enjoyed the sequence in which Rick and Glenn cover themselves in guts to disguise them from the zombies. He commented, "Overall, this episode had its fun moments, feeling more like an adrenalin-filled straight up horror movie than the more slow-paced pilot. But it also lacked the pilot's emotion and depth."
