            Michonne (Danai Gurira) is suspicious of how the Governor (David Morrissey) recovered supplies from a nearby National Guard camp, but he refuses to discuss it. She expresses her concerns with Andrea (Laurie Holden), and believes they should leave and head for the coast. Andrea would rather stay, and provides information on the Greene farmstead to allow Merle (Michael Rooker) to look for his brother Daryl. The Governor tells Merle he will allow the search once Merle obtains more concrete information. Andrea begins to become romantically involved with the Governor.

        <p id="para2">Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) discusses with the others about making the prison their permanent home. The two remaining prisoners Axel (Lew Temple) and Oscar (Vincent Ward) request to join the group, but Rick, still distrustful, informs them of his intent to send them away at the end of the week.

            The group gathers as Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) takes his first steps after the amputation of his foot. Suddenly, walkers swarm the courtyard, scattering the group. T-Dog (IronE Singleton) having been bitten when shutting the gate, races after Carol (Melissa McBride) and sacrifices himself by barreling into a walker horde to let her escape. Rick, Glenn (Steven Yeun), and Daryl (Norman Reedus) find the gate's lock broken and resecure it to prevent further walkers from entering. Rick accuses Axel and Oscar of the treachery, but an alarm begins sounding due to activation of a backup generator, potentially drawing more walkers. Rick realizes the prisoners cannot be at fault and lets them lead him to the generator room. There, they find Andrew (Markice Moore), whom Rick had left for dead, as the instigator. Andrew is about to kill Rick when Oscar shoots him, and then turns the gun over to Rick. They stop the generator and disable the alarm.

        <p id="para3">Elsewhere, Carl (Chandler Riggs) covers for his mother Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) as they take shelter in a boiler room. Lori has gone into labor, but is bleeding profusely during her contractions, thus unable to give birth properly in the boiler room. Lori demands Maggie perform a lethal Caesarean section to deliver the child, knowing it will kill her, but would rather die knowing her baby will live. The baby is delivered safely, but Lori dies; Carl takes a moment to mourn before shooting her in the head to prevent reanimation.

            With the walkers dealt with, the group rejoins in the courtyard, though Carol is still missing. Rick sees Carl and Maggie emerging from a cell block with the baby, but realizes Lori is not with them, and becomes hysterical.</p>

                Killer Within" was lauded by television commentators. The Washington Post entertainment journalist Jen Chaney said that "Killer Within" offered the "most emotionally upsetting development" in the series to date,[15] a sentiment echoed by Time's Nate Rawlings, who argued that the episode was The Walking Dead's most powerful installment since "Beside the Dying Fire".[16] Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for Rolling Stone magazine that "Killer Within" was the program's best episode to date.[17] The Huffington Post's Maureen Ryan described it as a "taut, terrifically paced hour" with an "incredibly powerful ending",[18] while Eric Goldman of IGN called it "an incredibly tense [and] unrelenting" episode in his 9.5 out of 10 review.[19]

                The fates of Lori and T-Dog garnered favorable reviews from television commentators. According to HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall, the moment when Lori and Carl share their goodbyes was the most heartbreaking event since the ending of the second-season episode "Pretty Much Dead Already".[20] Los Angeles Times columnist Laura Hudson felt it was a grim departure for a character who endured long bouts of grief for reasons beyond her control.[11] Erik Kain from Forbes magazine found Lori's death especially difficult to watch, and was shocked by T-Dog's "sudden" death despite the fact that he "was never as prominent a figure" on the program. "As hard as these deaths were to watch," Kain wrote, "they also give me faith in the show."[21] Even though he stated that T-Dog died "a hero's death", Michael Rapoport of The Wall Street Journal concluded that Lori's "gut-churning" demise was the more memorable.[22]

                Lori's demise was featured in The Huffington Post's list of "The Biggest 'OMG' TV Moments of 2012",[23] and placed nineteenth in Slate's article covering the year's most noteworthy television moments. Journalist Chris Kirk said that the segment was "utterly surprising", and pointed out that the writers beguiled viewers by shedding light onto Lori's crumbled relationship with Rick.[24]

                Some reviewers presented more negative critiques. Ted Pigeon of Slant asserted that, although the latter half of the installment contained some of the show's most touching material, the methodology behind its narratives was "all too apparent".[25] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club in his review felt the episode "stumble[d]" in how T-Dog and Lori were eliminated and in how the Woodbury storyline repeated what was already known. Handlen commented in his B+ review that "killing T-Dog and Lori earned the show an immediate thrill, but it also meant crossing off two potential sources of drama, people who had a history on the series, however thin or poorly developed that history might have been."[26]

                The performances of The Walking Dead ensemble was a frequent topic in the critiques. Lincoln's performance received kudos from various media outlets including HitFix, Rolling Stone, and Slate.[17][27][28] To Goldman, Lincoln's collapsing onto the ground was a "suitably powerful and evocative" gesture that epitomized the essence of the series. In addition, the IGN writer commended Callies, Riggs, and Cohan for their performances in "Killer Within".[19] Sepinwall added that Callies "absolutely sold" the portrayal of a mother saying "goodbye to the son who had to grow up much too quickly".
