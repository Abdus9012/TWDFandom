            Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) leads the group of survivors from Atlanta towards Fort Benning following the destruction of the CDC there. Rick attempts to contact Morgan Jones but cannot reach him.

            Along a highway, the group is forced to stop as a number of abandoned cars litter the road, making it impossible to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must stop to fix his RV. As the others push cars out of the way and scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.

        <p id="para2">The horde soon passes, and the group returns to clearing the road, while Rick and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) attempt to find Sophia. While Rick is gone, Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) tells Rick's wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) that he plans to leave the group on his own accord. Rick and Daryl return unsuccessfully, and the group spends the night to resume the search the next day. Carol berates Rick for losing Sophia.</p>

        <p id="para3"> During the search, Andrea (Laurie Holden) confronts Dale about her decision to stay at the CDC and wanting to die on her own terms, and his choice to stay with her took that chance away from her. The group finds a small church and dispatch the few walkers inside. As Carol prays for the return of her daughter, Andrea overhears Shane arguing with Lori about his leaving, and she tells him she wants to go with him. Rick, seeing the group starting to break apart, questions his leadership abilities and also prays for guidance.

            Rick, Shane, and Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) go hunting for food, and spot a deer nearby. As Carl goes up closer, a gunshot rings out, and Carl finds he has been shot in the stomach, falling over to Rick's shock.</p>
